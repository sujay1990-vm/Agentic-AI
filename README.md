# Agentic-AI

AI Agentic System for Insurance Use Case

Project Overview

This project builds an Agentic AI System for the Insurance Industry capable of handling natural language queries across structured and unstructured data sources. The system leverages AI Agents with access to SQL tables, vector stores, knowledge graphs, and multi-modal data (PDFs, images, videos) to provide dynamic, context-aware answers.

Phased Development Plan

Phase 1: Structured Data (SQL Tables)

Goal: Build the foundation using structured data and enable Text-to-SQL querying.

Tasks:

Create SQL database tables for:

Agents

Carriers

Underwriters

Claims

Populate mock data into the tables.

Develop a Text-to-SQL Querying Agent using GPT-4.

Test with multi-table queries, joins, and filtering conditions.

Deliverables:

Working SQL database with sample tables and data.

AI Agent capable of processing natural language queries into SQL.

Phase 2: Hybrid Data (Structured + Unstructured)

Goal: Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for unstructured data.

Tasks:

Create a pipeline to ingest PDFs, emails, and receipts into a vector store (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone).

Build a RAG Agent to enable semantic search and retrieval from the vector store.

Implement query routing to decide between SQL and RAG queries dynamically.

Merge structured and unstructured results for hybrid responses.

Deliverables:

Vector store integration with document ingestion.

RAG agent supporting unstructured data queries.

Phase 3: Multi-Agent System for Orchestration

Goal: Introduce multiple specialized agents for advanced workflows and decision-making.

Tasks:

Create specialized agents:

SQL Agent: Handles structured queries.

RAG Agent: Processes unstructured data.

Fusion Agent: Merges results from multiple sources.

Planning Agent: Breaks down complex queries into subtasks.

Enable dynamic query planning and orchestration.

Implement follow-up suggestions and reflection mechanisms to refine responses.

Deliverables:

Multi-agent orchestration for handling complex queries.

Unified output combining SQL and RAG results.

Phase 4: Multi-Modal Support (Images, Videos)

Goal: Extend support to handle images, videos, and multi-modal data analysis.

Tasks:

Integrate AI Vision Models (e.g., GPT-4 Vision, Google Gemini) for image and video analysis.

Build a Multi-Modal Agent capable of answering queries related to visual data.

Combine visual data insights with SQL and text-based results.

Deliverables:

AI Agent capable of analyzing images and videos.

Multi-modal responses combining visual and textual information.

Phase 5: Adaptive Models and Scaling

Goal: Add adaptive learning capabilities to improve performance over time.

Tasks:

Implement reinforcement learning for feedback-driven improvement.

Fine-tune models based on usage patterns and errors.

Introduce monitoring tools (e.g., MLflow) for performance tracking.

Optimize scalability with additional agents and data sources.

Deliverables:

Adaptive AI Agents that evolve based on feedback.

Monitoring systems for performance evaluation.
