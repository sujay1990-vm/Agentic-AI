# Agentic-AI

Phase 1: Foundation (Structured Data Only)
Goal: Start with structured data (SQL tables) and enable text-to-SQL querying.
Tasks:
Database Setup:

Create tables for Agents, Carriers, Underwriters, Claims, etc.
Populate them with mock data for testing.
Text-to-SQL Querying Agent (Step 1):

Build an agent using LangChain to interpret natural language queries and translate them into SQL queries dynamically.
Handle multi-table joins and filters based on query requirements.
Multi-Table Query Routing (Step 2):

Implement a query router that determines which table(s) the query should target.
Testing & Validation:

Ensure it can handle queries involving multiple tables (e.g., “Show me claims filed by underwriters for policies issued by Carrier X in 2023”).
Phase 2: Hybrid Data (Structured + Unstructured)
Goal: Add RAG capabilities for unstructured data like PDFs and emails.
Tasks:
Document Ingestion Pipeline:

Process and embed PDFs, emails, and receipts into a vector store (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone).
Use LangChain loaders to extract text and metadata.
RAG Integration Agent:

Extend the agent to support unstructured queries.
Example Query: “Summarize all receipts and claims filed by Agent X in the last 6 months.”
Response: Combine SQL query results with semantic search results from the vector store.
Query Routing Enhancements:

Route hybrid queries to both SQL and vector stores.
Fuse results into a single output using an LLM (e.g., GPT-4).
Testing & Validation:

Handle multi-modal queries like “Find all policies with missing signatures and attach related PDFs.”
Phase 3: Multi-Agent System for Orchestration
Goal: Introduce multiple agents with specialized roles to handle different data types and workflows.
Tasks:
Agent Roles:

SQL Agent: Handles structured database queries.
RAG Agent: Processes unstructured data queries via vector stores.
Fusion Agent: Merges outputs from SQL and RAG agents.
Planning Agent: Breaks down complex queries into sub-tasks and orchestrates execution.
Dynamic Query Planning:

Use frameworks like LangChain Agents or Auto-GPT to dynamically plan multi-step workflows.
Example: For “Show claims and receipts for Agent X with missing details,” the Planning Agent:
Queries SQL for claims.
Queries vector store for receipts.
Merges outputs and flags missing details.
Decision-Making and Follow-Ups:

Allow agents to reflect on results and suggest follow-ups.
Example: “Would you like me to identify policies with similar issues?”
Testing & Validation:

Ensure agents handle complex queries like:
“Summarize Q3 claims trends and highlight fraud risks.”
“List policies issued without receipts and attach PDFs.”
Phase 4: Multi-Modal Support (Images, Videos)
Goal: Add support for images and videos using AI Vision Models.
Tasks:
Image/Video Processing Pipeline:

Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 Vision or Google Gemini for analyzing photos of damage, videos of accidents, etc.
Multi-Modal Agent:

Extend the agent to handle multi-modal queries like:
“Analyze this image for damage and compare it with the claims data.”
“Summarize the video and extract key details for the claim.”
Data Fusion Enhancements:

Combine visual insights with SQL and text data.
Example: Highlight inconsistencies between image evidence and filed claims.
Testing & Validation:

Handle queries involving multi-modal reasoning.
Example: “Does the damage shown in the photo match the repair estimate in the claim?”
Phase 5: Monitoring and Scaling
Goal: Optimize performance, monitor logs, and scale the system.
Tasks:
Performance Monitoring:

Use tools like MLflow or LangSmith to monitor agent performance.
Error Handling and Debugging:

Add robust logging for failed queries or incomplete workflows.
Model Updates:

Fine-tune models if necessary to improve domain-specific accuracy.
Scaling Agents:

Expand agents to handle new workflows as data complexity grows.
Example: Add fraud detection agents or compliance-checking agents.
Key Technologies and Tools
LLMs: OpenAI GPT-4, HuggingFace models, Google Gemini.
Frameworks: LangChain, LlamaIndex (GPT Index), Auto-GPT.
Database Tools: SQLite (initial), PostgreSQL/MySQL (scalable).
Vector Stores: Pinecone, ChromaDB, Weaviate.
Knowledge Graphs: Neo4j, AWS Neptune (optional for later phases).
Vision Models: GPT-4 Vision, Google Gemini.
Monitoring Tools: MLflow, LangSmith.
Final Thoughts
This plan keeps things incremental and scalable.

Start with structured queries and scale to multi-modal workflows.
Introduce AI Agents step-by-step—beginning with SQL and RAG agents, then adding planners and decision-makers.
Test thoroughly at each phase to ensure stability before scaling.
