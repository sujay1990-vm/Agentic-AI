Agentic AI Solution—What We’ll Build:
Dynamic Query Reformulation:

Use LangChain ConversationalRetrievalChain or LangChain Agents with Memory to build robust query refinement.
Track history using Redis or SQLite memory buffers for longer context.
Schema and Metadata Extraction Agent:

Automatically read schemas from SQL databases instead of hardcoding metadata.
Cache schemas dynamically so the agent can pull metadata when needed.
Multi-Table Query Routing Agent:

Use planning and reasoning agents to route queries dynamically across multiple tables.
Support joins and relationships between tables using foreign keys.
Vector Store and Semantic Search Agent:

Use FAISS or Pinecone for semantic search across unstructured columns (e.g., text).
Enable hybrid retrieval—combine SQL with semantic vector search when needed.
Chunked Query Handling:

Break down large SQL results into chunks and summarize data before passing it to the LLM to avoid token limits.
Fallback and Reflection Mechanism:

Introduce reflection loops to evaluate answers and retry queries with adjusted parameters if results are empty or ambiguous.
Multi-Agent Collaboration:

Add sub-agents for query generation, reformulation, vector search, SQL execution, and result merging.

Architecture Plan:
User Query Input
→ Sent to Planning Agent for parsing and splitting tasks.

Query Decomposition:

SQL Agent handles structured data queries.
RAG Agent fetches unstructured data from vector stores.
Multi-Modal Agent processes images/videos (later phases).
Data Fusion Agent:

Combines results from all sources and summarizes them.
Evaluation Agent:

Reflects on outputs and refines queries if results are ambiguous or incomplete.
Response Generator:

Formats the final response for clarity and consistency.
